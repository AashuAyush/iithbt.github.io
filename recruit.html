							<p>a. Feminism is a movement of equal rights for men and women. But people take different meaning out of it and some are misusing it too. Here are some responses of college girls on recent Jasleen Kaur's case : "She is hurting feminism by misusing those rights."; "You're a girl and I'm a girl, and now people won't trust me also."; "Please don't make it difficult for other girls just for your publicity!". What does feminism mean to you? What is your take on Jasleen Kaur's case? Write in about 200 words.</p>
							<p>b. Tell us about the fantasy world which you have always thought of in your childhood and have always wished if it could be a reality. It could be anything like a fairy world, Noddy's Toyland or Chhota Bheem's Dholakpur! Write in word limit of 150-200 words.</p>
							<div id="special">
							<p>c. A picture is worth a thousand words. What we read in hundreds of words, a picture can tell it in a matter of seconds. Here, a picture is given to you.
